Example application to demonstrate the use of the [safe-app-android](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_app_java/tree/master/safe-app-android) library to build a simple ToDo Android App for the SAFE Network.

## Introduction

This example demonstrates use of the [safe-app-android](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_app_java/tree/master/safe-app-android) library to build a ToDo app for Android on the SAFE Network. There are two modes of the app showcased:
1. mock - user can build the app to work on a mock simulation of the SAFE Network, created on the users local device,
2. non-mock - user can build the app to work on the current live alpha-2 or local network.


## Pre-requisites

* Android Studio
* Java 8
* Android SDK


## Supported Platforms

Android API 24 and above (armeabi-v7a, x86_64 support).

## Features
* **Authentication using the [SAFE Authenticator](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-mobile):**
    
    A SAFE application needs to be authorised by the user before being able to connect to the network, this is achieved by sending an authorisation request to the SAFE Authenticator.
* **Mock & Non-mock flavours:**
    
    User should be able to easily switch between mock and non-mock using the [product flavours feature](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors) of Android Studio making it convenient to develop, test and build the apps on these environments.
* **Mutable data operations:**
    
    Perform CRUD operations on Mutable data.
* **Usage of App's Container:**
    
    Store mutable data information in an app's default container. This can be used to retain and retrieve data used in the application.
